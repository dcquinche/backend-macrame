# backend-macrame
This is my individual project as part of the Make It Real course. ItÂ´s called [Entre Tejidos Store](https://frontend-macrame.vercel.app/). It is composed of different modules, each one of them with its respective model and services.

## Built with
- TypeScript: as programming language and compiled into JavaScript.
- Node.js: to run the program (you can use **npm run dev**).
- MongoDB: to storage the data.

Some dependencies as:
- express: to build the server.
- mongoose: to structure the models data.
- dotenv: to read the environment variables (PORT, MONGO_DB_URI, CLOUDINARY_URL and SENDGRID_API_KEY).
- cloudinary: to upload images.
